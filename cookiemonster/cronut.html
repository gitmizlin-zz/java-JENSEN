    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol id="method">
        <li>
            <p>
                Place 0.25 ounce yeast into the mixing bowl of a large stand mixer.
                Whisk in 0.5 cup warm water and let stand until a creamy foam forms on top,
                about 5 minutes. Add 0.5 teaspoon salt, 2.5 tablespoons sugar, 0.5 cup milk,
                2 tablespoons melted butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1 large egg, and
                0.125 teaspoon nutmeg. Whisk mixture thoroughly. Pour 1 pound flour on top of
                liquid ingredients. Place mixing bowl onto mixer.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Attach dough hook to mixer and knead on low speed until dough comes together in a ball and becomes soft
                and sticky, about 3 minutes. Dough will stick to the hook and pull away from the
                side of the bowl.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Transfer dough to a floured work surface, knead 2 or 3 times, and shape into a ball.
                Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for 20 minutes to let gluten relax.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Remove dough from refrigerator, unwrap, and dust lightly with flour. Roll out into a
                9x18-inch rectangle about 1/4 inch thick. Evenly spread 6 tablespoons softened
                unsalted butter onto the middle third of the dough.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Fold one unbuttered third over
                the buttered third and press lightly; spread remaining 6 tablespoons of unsalted
                button on top of that third. Fold remaining third over the first (buttered) third.
                Transfer dough onto a sheet pan, cover lightly with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel,
                and refrigerate 20 to 30 more minutes for butter to become firm. Sprinkle dough
                lightly with flour as you work if it becomes sticky.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Return dough to floured work surface and pat very gently into an 8x14 rectangle about 1/2-inch thick.
                Fold outer thirds over center third as before; roll out into an 8x14-inch rectangle again.
                Keep edges of rectangle as straight as possible. Fold in thirds as before. Cover dough lightly
                with a kitchen towel, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Roll the dough out to about 3/8 inch thick. Cut dough in half crosswise. Leave half on a lightly
                floured work surface; refrigerate other half of dough until needed.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Use a sharp 3-inch circular cutter to cut 8 circles of dough from piece on the work surface. Use
                1-inch size cutter to cut the donut holes out of the dough circles.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Line a baking sheet with waxed paper and sprinkle lightly with flour. Arrange
                cronuts and holes onto prepared baking sheet. Let rise in a draft-free, warm place
                (such as an unheated oven) until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
